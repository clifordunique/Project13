Hey, take it easy now, sweetheart. I don't know nothin' about no 'summoning' or 'calling hence' nonsense.

[LSpeaking:T,RSpeaking:F]

Is that so? 

[]

...hmph. I suppose not. You lack the aura for it.

[LSpeaking:F,RSpeaking:T]

Right... 'aura'. Well now that we got that of the way, any chance you'd know the way of here or are you just as lost about this as I am?

[LSpeaking:T,RSpeaking:F]

Me? Lost? Hardly.

[LSpeaking:F,RSpeaking:T]

Really now. Then where are we?

[LSpeaking:T,RSpeaking:F]

Why would I bother myself with knowledge of the mortal realms?

[LSpeaking:F,RSpeaking:T]

...so you're lost.

[LSpeaking:T,RSpeaking:F]

Tch. Watch, pathetic human! I'll prove it to you. You wish to leave this cavern, do you not?

[LSpeaking:F,RSpeaking:T]

Wouldn't say no to some wide open space. 

[LSpeaking:T,RSpeaking:F]

Then follow me and I shall lead the way.
