Well at least one's thing gone right today. Looks like our Heroes have all gathered themselves for us. Spares us the trouble of finding them ourselves.

[LPort:Alice,LSpeaking:F,RPort:Ardent,RName:Ardent]

They're not the most awe inspiring bunch, are they? Are you certain this is them?

[LName:Alice,LSpeaking:T,RSpeaking:F]

You think I would mistake my own summoned?

[RSpeaking:T,LSpeaking:F]

Well they do seem rather...lackluster. I might even go as far as to say perhaps a touch criminal.

[RSpeaking:F,LSpeaking:T]

What are you talking about? Clearly you can tell just by looking at them that they're...

[RPort:Alice,LPort:Gunner,LName:Gunner]

Yeah well, you ain't no prize yourself.

Now I reckon based on what you were just sayin’ right now, we'll start gettin' answers. Like why are we here?

[RName:Alice,RSpeaking:T,LSpeaking:F]

Of course. We've gather you all here to save the universes.

Ain't going to elaborate on that or nothin'?

[RName:Ardent,RPort:Ardent,RSpeaking:T,LSpeaking:F]

We would if we could. Unfortunately however...
