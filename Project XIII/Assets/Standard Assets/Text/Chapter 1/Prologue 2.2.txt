GREETINGS, FRIENDS. WERE YOU ALSO TAKEN AWAY FROM YOUR HOME WORLDS BY A CROSS-DIMENSIONAL VORTEX?

[RPort:Swordsman,LSpeaking:F,RName:Swordsman,RSpeaking:T]

I see. More mongrels dragged into this farce of a summoning.

If you count the little light show I got caught up in before landing here, then yeah. Guess we’re all in the same boat, huh?

By the way, that's some nice armor you got there, handsome.

WHY THANK YOU. I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR MERCURY TREATED, HARE CARCASS HAT.

You're a funny talkin' one aren't you?
